# RaceswithFriends
a running application to connect to friends who run, and form running groups. We aren't reinventing the wheel, we're creating an app utilizing our current skillset around something we find enriching. 

The first time user creates an account -which is authenicated through Firebase.  They can then login for each subsequent use to access their saved runs.  

This app is made using:
  HTML
  CSS
  Materialize
  MySQL2
  Sequelize
  Firebase
  Heroku
  Javascript
  Node
  
Grabbing client side input with javascript, ajax calls are used to move the input to the server side.  Ajax also handles the data going to the client side. 
MySQL stores the database.  And Sequelize is a promise based ORM streamlining data flow.  

We chose Materialize because of the range of color and formatting options.  It was an intuitive tool when designing the UI.
