# **RaceswithFriends**
a running application to connect to friends who run, and form running groups. We aren't reinventing the wheel, we're creating an app utilizing our current skillset around something we find enriching.

The app supports:
* New Users
    * Requires an authentic email
* Logging Runs
    * Requires a date, distance, and time
* Making Friend Groups
    * Requires a name and a list of other users

**Functionality**

*Races with Friends* is a social media web application that allows each user to join friend groups and compete among friends while encouraging a healthy lifestyle. The main goal of the app is to keep people active and social during the time of quarentine and isolation. Knowing that there are already applications that achieve a similar goal we wanted to see just how we might solve the same problem in our own way.
